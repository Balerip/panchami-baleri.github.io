# About Me

Iâ€™m **Panchami Baleri**, a Data Engineer and Data Scientist passionate about designing scalable data ecosystems that make analytics faster, smarter, and more reliable.

Iâ€™m currently at **Squark AI**, where I develop data pipelines, balance skewed datasets, and automate model monitoring.  
Previously at **Infosys**, I built Spark-based ETL systems, AWS data warehouses, and BI dashboards that powered business decision-making.

When Iâ€™m not building pipelines, I co-lead **Google Developer Groups (GDG)** events, mentor peers, and explore innovations in GenAI and real-time data streaming.
